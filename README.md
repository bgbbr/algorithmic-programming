# Algorithmic and Competitive Programming Code Database [bholagabbar]

My complete Algorithmic/Competitive Programming Code Database in one place. 

This repository contains all the source code I have written till date (and will continue to do so) for algorithmic programming problems, data-structures and implementations and solutions to various Online Judge Problems such as CodeChef, SPOJ, CodeForces and the like. The primary aim of this repository is to act as a backup for all my source code if lost and also be of help to someone looking for algorithmic implementations/solutions to certain OJ problems for reference.  My handle on all of these platforms is [bholagabbar]

The organization of files is slightly indirect as there is a lot of navigation involved. This is because i git-push directly from my IDE (IDEA) and the files are arranged in such a way. Anyways, here are some of the locations for relevant code:

1. JAVA Code Database: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/src
[This folder contains folders CODECHEF, CODEFORCES, TOPCODER, SPOJ, DATASTRUCTURES and MISC. Solutions of problems solved by me on the relevant platform all al in here]

2. C++ Code Database: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/C%2B%2B%20Files
[The same as above. Problems are categorized as above. I also have decent implementations of standard algos and DS in the DS_ALGO folder. Do check them out. Also, I a lot of my codes are C++14 centric]

3. Python Scripts:https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/Python%20Scripts
[This contains scripts i made when i was learning Python. Solutions to a few SPOJ and CodeChef problems are also there. All of them are in Python 3]

4. College Stuff: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/College%20stuff
[This contains implementations of OOPS concepts and DS-ALGO course in my college. Pretty decent for an elementary-intermediate level implementation of stacks, queues, linked-list and more. All of these are in C++]

5. Coursera Stanford Algorithms Course: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/COURSERA_ALGOS1
[I also have implementations of programming questions asked and datastructures taught in the Coursera Algorithms course by Tim RoughGarden. Tried to make them as efficient as possible]

And finally a lot of mostly self explanatory miscellaneous stuff. 

As mentioned before, if you're scourging for some solutions to problems you could not solve or are looking for some correct and fairly efficent DS/ALGOS implementation, do consider checking my repository out. 

Thanks and help me fix a bug incase you stumble upon this repository and find one :)
